# Fine-Tuning a Stable Diffusion Model with HuggingFace's Diffusers Library

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of fine-tuning a stable diffusion model using HuggingFace's diffusers library. The stable diffusion model is a generative model that can be used for a variety of tasks, including image synthesis, text generation, and audio generation.

## Hardware

Running Stable Diffusion itself is not too demanding by today's standards, and fine tuning the model doesn't require anything like the hardware on which it was originally trained.
